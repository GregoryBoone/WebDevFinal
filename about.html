                Why You Should Go Camping
              </h3>
              <p>If you're like most Americans, you spend hours every day in an office staring at a computer screen. For the sake of your health (and your sanity) you need <em>something more</em>. You need to escape to the outdoors where you can explore nature at your leisure, observe wildlife in its natural element, and soak in the sun and fun.</p>

We've helped camping newbies and experienced campers alike to explore the great outdoors. We do this by providing resources on camping in various locales and by hosting special events throughout the year. Come give us a try; you won't regret it.</p>
